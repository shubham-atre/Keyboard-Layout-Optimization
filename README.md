# Optimal Keyboard Layout

QWERTY Layout dominates the keyboard world currently. However, there exist many possible
layouts that have potentially higher performance than QWERTY. In this programming exercise, I will try to generate an layout that is optimized for movement speed for a 6 by 5 virtual keyboard utilizing the Fittsâ€™ Law.

Our goal is to minimize the average movement time given as:

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%24%24t%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7BN%7D%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7BN%7DP_%7Bij%7DMT_%7Bij%7D%24%24)

One possible way to find the optimal layout is to first generate all possible layouts and then for
each layout, we compute the average movement time. However, this
brute-force approach is not computable since the number of possible layout (>10^26) is far
beyond our computing power. To tackle this problem, we use a kind of genetic algorithm- the
simulated annealing to approximate the optimal solution. The algorithm works like this:
Given a random starting layout, we randomly exchange the position of 2 keys. If the resulting
layout has lower average movement time, then we keep this layout and use this layout as the
starting layout for next iteration. After k iterations, if the average layout is not lowering anymore
by exchange 2 keys, then we stop and output the result.
